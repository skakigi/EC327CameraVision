This is an android app that is able to identify fruits using the androids camera. This app is meant for children education as, with future iterations, it may be able to identify any object and help children with understanding the world around them. The app takes the image and compares it to other example images in order to correctly identify what object is shown in the image captured. It then says what the object is.
